# Star Citizen Navigation

This project is a tool designed to help the navigation in Star Citizen.

This project was greatly inspired by the **"Murphy Exploration Group"** and more particularly by **Graupunkt#4414** who carried out a very similar program.

## General Info
This program relies almost entirely on the in-game `/showlocation` command. This command copies the global coordinates (relative to the center of the system) to the clipboard. This program continuously retrieves the contents of this clipboard and, if coordinates are found, interprets them in order to guide the user to his target.

The program itself is called [Star_Citizen_Navigation.py](Star_Citizen_Navigation.py). When launched, a terminal and another window should open. The window allows you to select the navigation mode and the desired target. Once the target is selected, the window should close and a `Program has started` should appear in the terminal.

From this moment the program is in working order.

The `Database.json` file contains all the data the program needs to operate (rotational speed of the planets, their location, coordinates of points of interest, etc.)

### Glossary 
- POI = Point Of Interest
- Container = The planets and moons on which the points of interest can be

### Displayed Informations
During navigation, various information are displayed:
- `Updated` : The time of the last command
- `Destination` : Your target
- `Global coordinates` : The global coordinates of your character
- `Actual Container` : The planet/moon you are around
       (red: bad star, yellow: in the middle of nowhere, green: around the star of your target)
- `Course Deviation` : The angle between your previous position, your current position and your target
       (red : Angle > 15째, Yellow : 15째 > Angle > 5째, green: 5째 > Angle)
- `Estimated time of arrival` : Approximate time of arrival at your target if the speed is kept constant

If you are around your target's container, two other pieces of information are displayed:
- `Local coordinates` : The local coordinates of your character (in relation to the star)
- `Distance to POI` : The distance between you and your target and the distance traveled to your target
       (green if you get closer, red if you move away)
